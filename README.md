## About Me

I'm a results-driven engineer with a background in creating delightful customer experiences through challenging issues. I'm proficient in full stack development and customer support with a passion for delivering high-quality user experiences.

## Professional Experience

- As Fullstory's Global Manager for Support Engineering, I expanded our team's reach to EMEA and APAC regions. I focused on mentoring ICs in complex problem-solving and enhancing their soft skills, significantly boosting customer satisfaction and team collaboration. My team maintained an average of 4.9 CSAT and 98% SLA achievement.
- I recently shifted to a new role to tackle our most challenging customer issues, enhancing ticket resolution efficiency and reducing need for engineering escalations by 52% in the first two months. I'm comfortable digging through unfamiliar codebases to pinpoint issues and am now working to refine support processes and ensure up-to-date knowledge sharing, collaborating effectively with engineering and product teams on complex cases.
- I was awarded for exceptional customer empathy at InVision, and became the trusted face of support at FullStory. I provide white-glove service for some of our largest customers. I excel at presenting deeply technical issues to non-technical stakeholders and executives. I also manage the most critical and sensitive incidents and have maintained a consistent 5-star CSAT rating for over four years.
- I am proficient in both front and back end technologies. I designed and built a full-stack web application to optimize support agent scheduling and ticket assignments. Focusing on skills-based routing, shftr [[demo](https://youtu.be/u1l6P-yYj6w)] significantly enhanced workload distribution and response efficiency, leading to a 75% reduction in median first response times for compliance tickets. The project involved utilizing various technologies such as Node.js, React, MongoDB and was later refactored in Go with Google Datastore and deployed within FullStory's tech stack.
