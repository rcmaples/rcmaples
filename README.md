## About Me

I'm a results-driven engineer with a background in full stack development and customer support with a passion for delivering high-quality user experiences. Seeking a role as a software engineer where I can leverage and grow my expertise while building innovative and intuitive tools that enhance the developer experience.

## Professional Experience

- As Fullstory's Global Manager for Support Engineering, I expanded our team's reach to EMEA and APAC regions. I focused on mentoring ICs in complex problem-solving and enhancing their soft skills, significantly boosting customer satisfaction and team collaboration. This approach led to an impressive average of 4.9 CSAT and 98% SLA achievement.

- Built a full-stack web application to optimize support agent scheduling and ticket assignments. Focused on skills-based routing, shftr [demo](https://youtu.be/u1l6P-yYj6w) significantly enhanced workload distribution and response efficiency, leading to a 60% reduction in median first response times for compliance tickets. The project involved utilizing various technologies such as Node.js, React, MongoDB and was then refactored in Go and deployed within FullStory's tech stack.

- I recently shifted into a new role to tackle our most challenging customer issues, enhancing ticket resolution efficiency and reducing need for engineering escalation by 40% in the first month, and 52% by the second month when compared with the previous nine months. I'm also working to refine support processes and ensure up-to-date knowledge sharing, collaborating effectively with engineering and product teams on complex cases.

- I was awarded for exceptional customer empathy at InVision, and now I'm the trusted face of support at FullStory. I provide white-glove service for some of our largest customers. I excel at presenting deeply technical issues to non-technical stakeholders and executives. I also manage the most critical and sensitive incidents and have maintained a consistent 5-star CSAT rating for over four years. My ability to empathically explain technical issues to non-technical stakeholders and executives has positioned me as the trusted support contact for Tier 1 customers. Additionally, I'm frequently called upon to manage our most sensitive and critical incidents outside of my normal rotation.

- As an expert in technical troubleshooting, I've leveraged tools like Loggly and Google Stackdriver for detailed analysis and investigation in various codebases. I've significantly enhanced support efficiency by integrating our staffing software with Zendesk, reducing compliance ticket response time by about 75%. Additionally, I've developed automated ticketing systems and custom Zendesk applications, improving support workflows and customer insights. My use of REST APIs for cross-tool integration has elevated reporting precision and strengthened cross-functional teamwork.
